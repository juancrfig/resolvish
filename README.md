# Resolvish

This program is created to solve boring and repetitive eduational online tests. 

1. Automate task related with interacting with web browsers
2. Learn how to listen audios and responding based on them
3. Generate accurate answers from prompts (maybe using the Chat GPT API)
4. Interact with websites
5. User Interface

## Python Web Automation Tools

To automate interactions with web elements I need to get comfortable with **web scraping** and **automation libraries**.

- Selenium: Python library for automate web browsers.
- BeatifulSoup: Parsing HTML, in case I need to extract data from the webpage.
- PyAutoGUI: A library for controlling the mouse and keyboard to automate desktop tasks, especially needed if the website requires non-browser interation.

### First Step

I will start learning about **Selenium** and **web element inspection** *(especially I need to learn how to identify buttins, forms, audio elements, etc.)
